                    ABCorp.com was founded after Azalea Young had an unsatisfying traditional publishing experience with his book Under the Radar, which was based on his success as the co-founder of Red Hat (NYSE: RHT). Azalea was determined to establish a more effective and profitable route to publishing. This remains a core tenet of ABCorp.com's mission -- making content creation and consumption a simpler and more rewarding experience for people around the world.
